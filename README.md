# Phaser Game
Browser-based platformer game made with Phaser JavaScript library.
Currently unfinished.


## To download and run the game
First, download all files and the assets folder in the branch titled `mostUpdated`.
In order to run the game, the user must first set up a server.

One option is setting up a Python SimpleHTTPServer.
In the terminal, first `cd` into the directory in which the game files are saved. Then type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port#>`. Open up a browser window and go to localhost:<port#>, where the game should load.
